      <p class="lead">$1 for $1 match up to $500</p>

<p>It doesn’t take much when you start to think about it.  If you have 15 kids in your club and each one of them can raise just $1 from 15 of their family members and neighbors then that would be $225.  With Pro Tournament Scales matching that by adding another $225 you’re up to $450.  That’s the cost of a brand new Model 357 scale.  Raise even more money and you can get the H2 or add a remote display!</p>
<p>PTS will match up to $500, that means if you raised $500 We’ll kick in $500 for a total of $1000 to spend.  If you raise more that’s okay too, we’ll still kick in $500.</p>
